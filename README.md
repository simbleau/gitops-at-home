## üìñ Overview
This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [__Ansible__](https://www.ansible.com/), [__Terraform__](https://www.terraform.io/), [__Kubernetes__](https://kubernetes.io/), [__Flux__](https://fluxcd.io/), [__Renovate__](https://renovatebot.com/) and [__GitHub Actions__](https://github.com/features/actions). Secrets are protected with modern [__Age__](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) encryption.

üí∞ _Every tool used is open source or used freely._

---

## üìÅ Directories

- [__`k8s`__](./k8s/): directory contains my Kubernetes configuration and artifacts.
- [__`provision`__](./provision/): directory contains my Ansible playbooks and roles for provisioning my home infrastructure.

---

## ‚õµ Kubernetes
I run a fully conformant Kubernetes cluster at home with K3S, provisioned overtop bare-metal Ubuntu 22.04 using Ansible. This is a semi hyperconverged cluster (HCI), with workloads and block storage sharing the same available resources from a centralized RAID 5 samba share.

üìò _[__Click here__](./k8s/README.md) to learn more about my cluster._

---

## üèÅ Provisioning
Currently, I automate the provisioning of the following systems at home:
- [__My Ubuntu workstation__](./provision/ubuntu-workstation/)
- [__My Kubernetes cluster__](./provision/k8s/)

üìô _[__Click here__](./provision/README.md) to see my Ansible playbooks and roles for provisioning my home infrastructure._

---

## üåê DNS
Over WAN, I have forwarded ports `80` and `443` from my router. I use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a proxy to hide my home WAN IP and to firewall certain traffic, [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) as my external DNS, and [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) as my internal DNS.

üìó _[__Click here__](./k8s/README.md#-dns) to see how DNS is handled by my cluster._

---

## ü§ñ GitOps
- [__Flux__](https://fluxcd.io/) watches my [`cluster`](./k8s/cluster/) folder and makes the changes to my cluster automatically, based on the YAML manifests.
- [__Renovate__](https://renovatebot.com/) watches the repository for dependency updates, and automatically generates PRs for them. Automerging is allowed.
- [__GitHub Actions__](https://github.com/features/actions) validates and tests push and merge requests for conflicts.
- [__GitHub Pages__](https://pages.github.com/) automatic deployment enables my repository to act as a Helm registry.
